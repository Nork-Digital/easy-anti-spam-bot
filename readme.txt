== Description ==

Hide email from Spam Bots using a shortcode [email]your@email.com[/email]

How the plugin Work?
The email entered within the [email][/email] shortcode is camouflaged in the source code, thus preventing bad bots that scour the internet from being able to read and find your email.


This plugin is based on standard functionality antispambot (https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/antispambot)
Works perfectly with all themes and editors of Wordpress


PT-BR
O e-mail inserido dentro do shortcode [email][/email] é camuflado no código fonte, impedindo assim que bad bots que vasculham a internet consigam ler e encontrar o seu e-mail.
